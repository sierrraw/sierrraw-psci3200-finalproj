    "text": "2. Theory and Hypotheses\n\nHypothesis 1\nMormons, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Adventists will think more highly of the US than the mainstream Christian population.\nBecause these religions all originated in the US and most people in these religions in Latin America will be converts, I hypothesize they will have more positive exposure to Americans and US beliefs. This is because people in these religions will be more likely to have had exposure to Americans through missionaries and if they think positively of the religion, they may associate this with positive feelings towards America, where such religions originated. Influential members of these religions are also Americans, which may increase this effect. Therefore, they will be more favorable towards the US than the average person in a mainstream Christian religion.\n\n\nHypothesis 2\nMormons, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Adventists with lower education levels will have lower favorability of the US compared to those with higher education.\n\n\nHypothesis 3\nMormons, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Adventists who are more devout will have more favorable opinions of the US.\nThe effect of being Mormon, a Jehovah’s Witnesses, or Adventists and being more devoted to religion will increase the likelihood that someone will be favorable towards the US. As people become more devoted to their religion, their engagement with American ideas and individuals may increase, which increases their favorability towards America as a whole. For example, they may wish to learn about church history, which took place in the US, and gain more understanding of the US as a whole. This could increase their favorability of the US."

Among Fringe Christians, 63% of respondents had unfavorable opinions and 31% had favorable opinions. Among Catholics and Evangelicals, only 21% adn 18% had unfavorable opnions, respectively.

By comparing favorability towards the US between individuals in fringe Christian religions and mainstream Catholics and Evangelicals, we attempt to distinguish what role nationality plays alongside religion. In this analysis, six countries (Costa Rica, Rep. Dominicana, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panamá) were removed due to insufficient data.\nThe effects of nationality on favorability towards the US vary across countries. Average favorability towards the US is lowest in countries like Venezuela (5.4) and Bolivia (5.5) and highest in countries like Colombia (6.7) and Ecuador (7.2). In Venezuela and Mexico, there is a large difference between the national average favorability and the fringe Christian average favorability.

There is a large range of education levels in Latin America, and education, or lack thereof, significantly effects political beliefs. maybe find a source Therefore comparing favorability towards the US across different education levels is helpful to understand why those in fringe Christian groups have lower favorability.\nFor Catholics with low education, the average favorability towards US was 6.4. Compared to Catholics, individuals with a low education in a fringe Christian religion had a 0.106335 decrease in favorability. Among Catholics, when education level increases within the low education group, there is a 0.022583 increase in favorability. The difference in the effect of education level on fringe Christian individuals compared to Catholics is not significant. Compared to Evangelicals, fringe Christians with low level of education experience a 0.270 decrease in favorability. Among Evangelicals within the low education group, education level does not significant effect favorability. However, the effect of education level on fringe Christian individuals compared to Evangelicals is significant, with a change of 0.035.\nFor medium education respondents, among Catholics and Evangelicals, an increase in education level does not significant effects favorability. The effect of fringe Christian identity was significant and compared to Catholics and Evangelicals, was found to decrease favorability by -1.064 and -1.099, respectively. There was also a significant effect of education level on fringe Christian individuals compared to Catholics Evangelicals, with a positive effect of 0.209 and 0.210.\nFinally, for high education respondents, none of the variables or interaction terms was found to significantly effect favorability towards the US.\nThese results suggest that among low education respondents, being in a fringe religion decreases favorability, compared to both Catholics and Evangelicals. An increase in education among low education respondents had a significant but small effect on Catholics and Evangelicals. For individuals in a fringe Christian religion with low education, an increase in education does increase favorability compared to Evangelicals. Among individuals with a medium education, an increase in education does not increase favorability for Catholics and Evangelicals. However, for those in a fringe Christian religion with medium education, an increase in education does increase favorability. Individuals’ favorability towards of US in the high education group was not significantly affected by any of these variables.\nOverall, compared to low and medium education respondents, fringe Christian individuals had significantly lower favorability ratings. We see that for individuals with a medium education and in a fringe Christian religion, an increase in education increases favorability. Therefore, religion plays a significant role in favorability beliefs for people with a low and medium education, and if an individual already has medium education and they are in a fringe Christian relgion, more education can increase their favorability. For people with a high education, the ability of additional education or religion to significant affect one’s political beliefs is decreased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Education, Catholic\nLow Education, Evangelical\nMedium Education, Catholic\nMedium Education, Evangelical\nHigh Education, Catholic\nHigh Education, Evangelical\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.623\n0.718\n0.612\n0.647\n0.742\n0.793\n\n\n\np = &lt;0.001\np = &lt;0.001\np = &lt;0.001\np = &lt;0.001\np = &lt;0.001\np = &lt;0.001\n\n\nchristian_small\n−0.175\n−0.270\n−1.064\n−1.099\n0.421\n0.370\n\n\n\np = 0.004\np = &lt;0.001\np = &lt;0.001\np = &lt;0.001\np = 0.354\np = 0.417\n\n\nREEEDUC.1\n0.005\n−0.006\n0.008\n0.008\n−0.013\n−0.017\n\n\n\np = 0.001\np = 0.018\np = 0.421\np = 0.621\np = 0.272\np = 0.339\n\n\nchristian_small × REEEDUC.1\n0.023\n0.035\n0.209\n0.210\n−0.068\n−0.063\n\n\n\np = 0.057\np = 0.005\np = 0.001\np = 0.002\np = 0.325\np = 0.361\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n9839\n4453\n4183\n1739\n2476\n960\n\n\nR2\n0.003\n0.009\n0.005\n0.014\n0.001\n0.004\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.002\n0.009\n0.004\n0.013\n0.000\n0.001\n\n\nAIC\n3567.7\n1658.0\n1308.4\n616.3\n674.5\n231.1\n\n\nBIC\n3603.6\n1690.0\n1340.1\n643.6\n703.5\n255.4\n\n\nLog.Lik.\n−1778.829\n−823.982\n−649.186\n−303.152\n−332.235\n−110.528\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n8.358\n\n1.409\n\n\nRMSE\n0.29\n0.29\n0.28\n0.29\n0.28\n0.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevotion ??"
