These religions are all relatively recent offshoots of Christianity that require a high degree of devotion from its followers and missionary efforts from these religions have successfully converted millions in Latin America. I am interested in whether Fringe Christians in Latin America are more favorable to the US, as a result of this. This paper aims to to study Fringe Christians in comparison to the dominant religion, Catholicism, as well as Evangelical Christianity, another quickly growing Christian sect.\nIn the US, members of these Fringe Christian religions hold different views from traditional mainstream Christian beliefs. Mormons overwhelmingly vote Republican, but Utah (over 60% Mormon) residents support issues like gun reform, the ERA, and increased sexual education (Larsen 2022). Adventists are one of the most devout religious groups in the US but have varied political beliefs (Lipka 2015). Jehovah’s Witnesses developed within the Adventist movement in the 19th century in the US (2024). They tend to be conservative, but remain politically inactive (Lipka 2016). Together, these three religions will be referred to as Fringe Christian religions.\nIn Latin America, rates of religious participation have declined in the past few decades, also decreasing the influence of religious institutions. With the rise of Protestantism (which includes Evangelicalism), atheism, and fringe American Christian religions (Seventh Day Adventists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Mormonism) from the mid 1800s onward, the long-dominant Catholic Church found itself struggling for continued influence. After several failed strategies to renew Catholic fervor, the Catholic Church began a new effort to sever ties with the political elite and refocus on helping the rural and urban poor (Gill 1998). In the 1960s and 1980s in some Latin American countries like Brazil, Chile, and Argentina, the Catholic Church stood against dictatorships and promoted democracy (Jelen and Wilcox 2002). Today, Latin America’s religious landscape is still 69% Catholic, however, this is less Catholic than in previous decades. On average, Catholics are also less devout than Protestants (Lipka 2014).\nMormonism surged starting in the latter half of the 20th century in Latin America. The Mormon population grew from around 700,000 in 1980 to 4.5 million in 2004 (making up over a third of the worldwide Mormon population at the time). One recent convert remarked: “Mormonism is an American form of Christianity in that it represents all of the American values of self-discipline and self-reliance” (Ayala 2004). Most members are concentrated in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru. However, within these countries, Mormon membership is unevenly distributed due to political, social, and cultural factors that affect the populace’s engagement with the religion. Mormonism is also concentrated in urban areas (similar to in the US) and is described as having a “middle class” character to its structure and values. Most Mormon leaders are a mix of Latin Americans and non-Latin Americans and come from the middle or upper class, since becoming a leader requires intense time and education commitments (Knowlton 1996).\nAccording to reports from the Seventh-Day Adventist global organization, there are over 2 million Seventh Day Adventists in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, making up the South American Division. Throughout much of the 20th century, Adventists in these countries were led by North Americans. From the mid 1970s onward, the leadership has been made up of Brazilians (Holdorf 2021). The Inter-American Division of the Seventh Day Adventists includes Mexico, Belize, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, French Guiana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Suriname, Venezuela, and other islands in the Caribbean. As of 2020, this division reported over 3.8 million members. Out of the 13 global Seventh Day Adventist divisions, the Inter-American Division is one of the largest and fastest growing divisions (Phillips and Leito 2020).\nThe Jehovah’s Witnesses website reports over 2.5 million members in Latin American countries (2023). Jehovah’s Witnesses are instructed to be involved with the secular world as little as possible because the world will soon become increasingly evil. Members are encouraged to convert as many people as possible to show religious devotion. Typically, equals convert equals, meaning potential converts are faced with missionaries of a similar social status. This approach has led to large-scale success in South America (Alston and Aguirre 1979)."

    "text": "2. Theory and Hypotheses\n\nHypothesis\nMormons, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Adventists will think more highly of the US than the mainstream Christian population.\nBecause these Fringe Christian religions all originated in the US and many people in these religions in Latin America will be converts, I hypothesize they will have more positive exposure to Americans and US beliefs. This is because people in these religions will be more likely to have had exposure to Americans and American values through missionaries and religious messaging. They may associate positive feelings regarding their religion with positive feelings towards America, where such religions originated. Influential members of these religions are also Americans, which may increase this effect. Therefore, people in Fringe Christian religions will be more favorable towards the US, compared to Catholics and Evangelicals.\nAdditionally, in studies of Pentecostal converts in Guatemala, researchers saw that “pentecostalized religious beliefs and charismatic experiences” across religious affiliations in Guatemala appear to be the most important religious factors driving political attitudes and actions (Steigenga and Cleary 2007). That is to say that Pentecostalism had a significant effect on political attitudes and actions. Similarly, I expect that Fringe Christian religious attitudes will affect many aspects of an individual’s life."

    "text": "5. Empirical Extension\n\nDevotion\nFringe Christians are more likely to describe themselves as “Very devout” and “Devout” than Catholics and Evangelicals. This may be due to the nature of the religions themselves, as Mormonism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Adventists demand greater participation from its members, which in turn, may make members feel more devout than other mainstream Christian religions. Therefore, it is unlikely that Fringe Christian religions simply attract individuals with a high propensity for religious devotion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased devotion was found to have a significant effect on Catholics, increasing their favorability towards the US by 0.17. However, increased devotion was not found to have a significant effect on Evangelicals or Fringe Christians.

In my data, Fringe Christians, Catholics, and Evangelicals have a similar average level of education, indicating that self selection into a Fringe Christian group is not associated with education. The median member of all of these groups has some secondary education. Comparing favorability towards the US across different education levels is helpful to understand why those in Fringe Christian groups have lower favorability.\nLow Education:  For Catholics with low education, the average favorability towards US was 6.2. Compared to Catholics, Fringe Christian individuals with a low education had a -0.6 decrease in favorability. Among Catholics, when education level increases within the low education group, there was a 0.02 increase in favorability. The difference in the effect of education level on Fringe Christian individuals compared to Catholics was not significant.\nCompared to Evangelicals, Fringe Christians with low level of education experienced a 0.92 decrease in favorability. Among Evangelicals within the low education group, additional education level was associated with a 0.02 decrease in favorability. However, additional education had a positive effect of 0.12 on Fringe Christian individuals compared to Evangelicals.\nMedium Education:  For Catholic and Evangelical medium education respondents, an increase in education level did not significant affect favorability. Compared to Catholics and Evangelicals, Fringe Christian identity was found to decrease favorability by 3.65 and 3.77, respectively. Additional education did not significant effect favorability among Catholics and Evangelicals, but there was also a significant effect of additional education on Fringe Christian individuals compared to both groups, with a positive change of 0.72 for both comparisons.\nHigh Education:  Finally, for high education respondents, neither additional education nor religious group was found to significantly effect favorability towards the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Education, Catholic\nLow Education, Evangelical\nMedium Education, Catholic\nMedium Education, Evangelical\nHigh Education, Catholic\nHigh Education, Evangelical\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.623\n0.718\n0.612\n0.647\n0.742\n0.793\n\n\n\np = &lt;0.001\np = &lt;0.001\np = &lt;0.001\np = &lt;0.001\np = &lt;0.001\np = &lt;0.001\n\n\nchristian_small\n−0.175\n−0.270\n−1.064\n−1.099\n0.421\n0.370\n\n\n\np = 0.004\np = &lt;0.001\np = &lt;0.001\np = &lt;0.001\np = 0.354\np = 0.417\n\n\nREEEDUC.1\n0.005\n−0.006\n0.008\n0.008\n−0.013\n−0.017\n\n\n\np = 0.001\np = 0.018\np = 0.421\np = 0.621\np = 0.272\np = 0.339\n\n\nchristian_small × REEEDUC.1\n0.023\n0.035\n0.209\n0.210\n−0.068\n−0.063\n\n\n\np = 0.057\np = 0.005\np = 0.001\np = 0.002\np = 0.325\np = 0.361\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n9839\n4453\n4183\n1739\n2476\n960\n\n\nR2\n0.003\n0.009\n0.005\n0.014\n0.001\n0.004\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.002\n0.009\n0.004\n0.013\n0.000\n0.001\n\n\nAIC\n3567.7\n1658.0\n1308.4\n616.3\n674.5\n231.1\n\n\nBIC\n3603.6\n1690.0\n1340.1\n643.6\n703.5\n255.4\n\n\nLog.Lik.\n−1778.829\n−823.982\n−649.186\n−303.152\n−332.235\n−110.528\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n8.358\n\n1.409\n\n\nRMSE\n0.29\n0.29\n0.28\n0.29\n0.28\n0.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results suggest that among low education respondents, being in a Fringe Christian religion decreased favorability, compared to both Catholics and Evangelicals. An increase in education among low education respondents had a significant but small effect on Catholics and Evangelicals. For individuals in a Fringe Christian religion with low education, an increase in education increased favorability compared to Evangelicals. Among individuals with a medium education, an increase in education did not increase favorability for Catholics and Evangelicals. However, for those in a Fringe Christian religion with medium education, an increase in education did increase favorability. Individuals’ favorability towards of US in the high education group was not significantly affected by any of these variables.\nOverall, low and medium education Fringe Christians had significantly lower favorability ratings, compared to low and medium education Catholics and Evangelicals. For individuals with a medium education and in a Fringe Christian religion, an increase in education increased favorability. This indicates that religion plays a significant role in favorability for people with a low and medium education. Additionally, additional education for an individual with medium education and in a Fringe Christian religion can significantly increase their favorability. For people with a high education, the ability of additional education or religion to significant affect one’s political beliefs is not significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nNational politics may also play a large role in how people view the US. By comparing favorability towards the US between individuals in Fringe Christian religions and mainstream Catholics and Evangelicals, we attempt to distinguish what role nationality plays alongside religion. In this analysis, six countries (Costa Rica, Rep. Dominicana, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panamá) were removed due to insufficient data.\nThe effects of nationality on favorability towards the US vary across Latin America. Average favorability towards the US was lowest in countries like Venezuela (5.4) and Bolivia (5.5) and highest in countries like Colombia (6.7) and Ecuador (7.2). In Venezuela and Mexico, there was a large difference between the national average favorability and the Fringe Christian average favorability. Meanwhile in Ecuador, there was not a large difference between the national average favorability and the Fringe Christian average favorability.

The interaction effect of country and religion was also not always found to be significant and also varied in magnitude. In some countries, nationality and religion did significantly affect favorability, however in other countries, only one or neither variable was found to be significant. This indicates large variability across Latin American and prompts further research into how national attitudes differ across Latin America.\n\n\nCountryNational AverageCatholic National AverageEvangelical National AverageFringe Christian National AverageDifference (National Average)Difference (Catholic)Difference (Evangelical)Venezuela0.53575820.53087460.55041920.4240909-0.11166727-0.10678368-0.126328253Bolivia0.55213690.55965230.54395160.5197674-0.03236949-0.03988485-0.024184171Argentina0.56172020.56531340.51508770.3350000-0.22672015-0.23031339-0.180087719Uruguay0.59013510.60400000.57770830.5010000-0.08913514-0.10300000-0.076708333Paraguay0.60389660.60468350.61126760.66750000.063603420.062816460.056232394Perú0.61420900.61319210.60705610.66062500.046415990.047432950.053568925México0.63586800.64407220.64764710.5418750-0.09399302-0.10219716-0.105772059Brasil0.64491110.63690270.66184310.67000000.025088890.033097350.008156863Chile0.65847410.67769620.56571430.5353333-0.12314078-0.14236291-0.030380952Colombia0.67184570.67405560.67487050.6072727-0.06457295-0.06678283-0.067597739Ecuador0.71784910.72406760.70975960.73500000.017150940.010932420.025240385"

    "text": "6. Discussion and Policy Implications\nBeing in a Fringe Christian religion was found to decrease an individual’s favorability of the US.\nIn my survey, Fringe Christians had a similar level of education compared to Catholics and Evangelicals, although they were more devoted than both groups. Devotion was found to increase favorability only for Catholics.\nFavorability towards the US varies widely across Latin America. One of the strongest predictors of favorability in Latin America is distance from the US, meaning the individuals in Central America are more favorable than individuals in South America. The next most important factor is receiving money from US emigrants (2016). This shows that proximity and perceived economic benefit play a large role in favorability of the US.\nAdditionally, national politics also seem to affect the popularity of the US. Countries previously or currently governed by leftists, such as Venezuela or Bolivia, are more likely to disfavor the US than countries governed by conservatives, such as Peru or Colombia. In Latin American countries with high murder rates, typically associated with drug shipments to the north, favorability is also lower (2016).\nHowever, this does not explain why as a whole, Mormons, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Adventists tend to view the US less favorably.\nIn the US, increased education was found to increase religious attendance at the individual level, but decrease religious beliefs (Glaeser and Sacerdote 2008). In Canada, researchers found that higher levels of education lead to lower levels of religious affiliation later in life (Hungerman 2014). In my research, the beliefs of respondents with some university education were not significantly affected by either an increase in education or joining a Fringe Christian religion. However, these results are still difficult to explain.\nAre there other important factors you can control for, like wealth? That seems like something that could be a cause of both fringe religion and perceptions of US.\nThis also shows that looking at Latin American countries together might not be effective to find trends in political beliefs.\nIn regards to policymaking, this research shows that religion continues to influence opinions and people of different religions also may have significantly different beliefs. Although most religious institutions and religious leaders do not explicitly espouse political ideals, the mindset and actions that religions promote have the potential to permeate through all aspects of one’s life.
